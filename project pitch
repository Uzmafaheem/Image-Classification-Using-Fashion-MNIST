# Image-Classification-Using-Fashion-MNIST
## 🧵 Project Pitch: Image Classification Using Fashion-MNIST
### 📌 1. Business Problem Scenario
#### Business Problem
- In e-commerce retail, product misclassification results in inaccurate catalogs, poor search results, and inefficient inventory management. With thousands of new product images uploaded daily, manual tagging is slow, error-prone, and inconsistent.
This project aims to build an automated image classification model to categorize clothing items using machine learning.

#### Stakeholders
- E-commerce Operations Team – reduced manual tagging workload
- Inventory & Supply Chain Team – improved stock categorization
- Marketing / Recommendation Systems Team – higher-quality inputs
- Customers – improved search and product discovery
- Executives – reduced costs and increased conversion rates

#### Business Goals
- Reduce mislabeling errors by ≥25%
- Improve catalog accuracy for inventory visibility
- Enhance customer search accuracy
- Reduce returns related to incorrect product details

#### Why Machine Learning?
- Fashion image classification has too much variation for rule-based systems. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, can automatically detect complex visual patterns (texture, shape, edges) and scale to thousands of images per day with consistent quality.

### 📁 Dataset Description
- Dataset: Fashion-MNIST
- Source: TensorFlow / Keras / Kaggle
- Size: 70,000 grayscale images (28×28 px)
       - 60,000 training
       - 10,000 test

- Classes (10):
        - T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle Boot

- Relevancy:
       - The dataset represents real-world clothing categories and serves as an ideal testing ground for building an automated classification pipeline that can later be applied to actual product images.

### 🎯 Success Metrics
- Technical Metrics
       - Accuracy (primary)
       - F1-score (macro)
       - Confusion matrix for class-level errors
- Business Metrics
      - Reduction in manual tagging time
      - Fewer catalog errors
      - Improved search recommendation accuracy
      - Decrease in product returns from mismatched descriptions

### 🧩 2. Problem-Solving Process
#### A. Data Acquisition & Understanding
     - Load Fashion-MNIST using Keras API
     - Inspect shapes, data types, and pixel properties
     - Check class distribution
     - Early visuals:
     - Random image grids
     - Pixel intensity histograms
     - Class countplots

#### B. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering
- Data Cleaning
     - Normalize pixel values: [0,1]
     - Reshape to (28,28,1)
     - Create train/val/test splits

- Feature Engineering
  -  Image augmentation:
          - Rotation
          - Zoom
          - Translation
- One-hot encoding for labels
- Scikit-Learn Pipeline
         - A hybrid pipeline integrating preprocessing + Keras model:
         - Normalization
         - Augmentation
